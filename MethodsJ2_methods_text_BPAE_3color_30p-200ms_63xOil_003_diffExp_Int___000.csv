MethodsJ1 warnings:,, No physical step size detected. The image might be missing some crucial metadata. The exposure time was divided by 1000 to allow reporting in seconds in .czi file format for channel 1. The exposure time was divided by 1000 to allow reporting in seconds in .czi file format for channel 2. The exposure time was divided by 1000 to allow reporting in seconds in .czi file format for channel 3.
MethodsJ1 text generation based on the metadata: ,,"The selected image has a width of 1012 pixels, a height of 1020 pixels, 3 channel(s), 1 slice(s), and 1 frame(s), with a dimensional order of XYCZT. The lateral pixel size is 0.14 microns. Imaging data was acquired on a Zeiss widefield system, using a 63x 1.4 NA objective. The excitation and emission wavelengths for channel 1 were 353 nm and 465 nm and the exposure time was 100.00 ms. The excitation and emission wavelengths for channel 2 were 488 nm and 509 nm and the exposure time was 150.00 ms. The excitation and emission wavelengths for channel 3 were 551 nm and 575 nm and the exposure time was 200.00 ms. "
